Description: Provides a unified interface to run SQL queries against Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, PostgreSQL, SQLite and DuckDB from R. Optionally streams large remote query results directly into a local DuckDB file for fast, reproducible, low-cost analytics. Snowflake queries are executed via the snowflake-connector-python through reticulate; the package auto-installs and enforces a minimum connector version. Credentials are managed via a single YAML file supporting multiple named connections.
